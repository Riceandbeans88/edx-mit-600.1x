Make tests for these conditions
T/F

1.1
The ONLY thing we are interested in when designing programs is that it returns the correct answer.

1.2
Roughly speaking, under the RAM model of computation, adding two numbers takes the same amount of time as dividing them.

1.3
When determining asymptotic complexity, we discard all terms except for the one with the largest growth rate.

1.4
Bisection search is an example of linear time complexity

1.5
For large values of n, an algorithm that takes 20000n^2 steps
has better time complexity (takes less time) than one that takes 0.001n^5 steps
